	<text>Peace is Union, life, prosperity war is
disunion, strife, dissolution, death. What
' are Sumter and Pickens in a question of such
magnitude ? What can the Federal adminis
tration gain by holding them for a few weeks
or for a few months? Can it thereby enforce
any law ? Can it collect any revenue ? Can
it bring back the seceded States to the Union,
and restore brotherhood and confraternity ?
Can it benefit a partizan administration, or
the citizens of the country ? Can the Federal
Government, by holding these Forts over
power the "Confederate States," and reduce
them to the condition of subject provinces,
if that be the policy ? Is any of these ends
to be reached by holding Sumter and Pick
ens ? Who is so obtuse as to believe it?
The theory of the seceded States is that
these forts belong to them, and that their oc
cupation by an authority which they do not
recognise, is an act of hostility in itself.</text>

	<text>Iy these despatches it will be seen that the treason which has so
long been rife at Charleston, has at last culminated in WAR ! The
rebels will now be treated in a different manner than they anticipa
ted. They have brought down vengeance on their own heads. The
country waits with breathless anxiety to, know the result of this at
tack. We believe the Government is sufficient for the emergency.
Without further remarks we give the despatches:
Charleston, April 12th. The following is the
telegraphic correspondence between the War
Department at Montgomery and Oen. Beaure
gard immediately preceding the hostilities. The
c orrefrpondence grew out of the formal notifica
tion by the Washington Government which is
disclosed in Oen. Beauregard's first dispatches:
No.1. Charleston, April 8th, 1861.
L. T. Walkkb, Secretary of War: An au
thorized inotwvnger from President Lincoln just
informed Gov. Pickens and mysell that provis
ions will be sent to Fort Sumter peaceably, or

A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas the laws of the United States have
been for tome time past, and now are, opposed,
and the execution thereof obstructed, in the
States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, by
combinations too powerful to be suppressed by
the ordinary course of judicial proceeding, or
by the powers vested in the marshals by law :
Now, therefore, I, Abhahim Lixcolv, Presi
dent of the United States, in virtue of tho
power in me vested by the Constitution and the
laws, have thought fit to call forth, and do
hereby call forth, the militia of the several
States of tho United States of the Union, to the
aggregate number of seventy-five thousand, in
order to suppress said combinations, and to
cause the laws to be duly executed. ... The delay in the arrival of the" fleet nt
Charleston, which resulted from the storm, was
most opportune for the rebels, although, under
the circumstances of the short resistance made
by Fort Sumter, it did not probably change the
issue of stents.

Anderson acted wisely in evacuating Fort
Moultrie, and occupying Fort Sumpter.
Military men at the east, are in extacies
over the movement, and it is only objected
to by the secessionists. It is conceded that
it would require a continuous bombardment
of six months with guns of the heaviest
metal to destroy Fort Sumpter, and then it
coaid only be done, if at all, by chipping off
the masonry piece by piece; The New
York Herald gives the best sketch we have

	<text>PRESIDENT'S MESSIGE.
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate
and of the House of Representatives :
Having been convened on an extraordinary
occasion, authorized by the Constitution, your
attention is not called to an ordinary subject of
legislation.
At the beginning ol the present Presidential
term, four months ago, the functions of the Fed
eral Government were found to be generally
suspended within the several States of'South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Lou
isiana and Florida, excepting those onlv of the
Post office Department.
Within these States all the forts, arsenals,
dockyards, custom-houses, and the like, inclu
ding the movable and stationary property in
and about them, had been seized and held in o
pen hostility to this Government, excepting on
ly Forts Pickens, Taylor and Jefferson, on and
near the Florida coast, and Fort Sumpter, in
Charleston Harbor, South Carolina.
The forts thus seized had b-en put in impro
ved condition, new ones had been built, and ar
med forces had been organized, and were orga
nizing, all avowedly with the same hostile pur
pose. The forts remaining in the possession of
the Federal Government in and near these
Sfatps were either besieged or menaced by war
like preparations, and especially Fort Sumpter
was nearly surrounded by well protected hos
tile batteries, with guns equal in quality to the
best of its own, and outnumbering the fatter,
perhans, two to one.</text>

	<text>General Beauregard at two oâ€™clock to-day
demanded the surrender of Fort Sumpter,
which Major Anderson declined. It is
currently reported that negotiations relative
to the surrender will be opened to-morrow
between Anderson and Beauregard.
Special despatches received at Washing
ton to-day assert that both Pickens and
Sumpter will be attacked, but they doubt
if war follows.
A Montgomery despatch to-day says it
has been resolved to attack the two forts
immediately.
Three steamers were seen off the coast
yesterday for a long time. Anderson fired
a signal gun this morning. The attack of
Fort Sumpter is momentarily expected.
Business is suspended. It is rumored that
the fight will commence at eight oâ€™clock
this evening, unless Major Anderson sur
renders.
The steamer Harriet Lane is off the bar.
Thousands of persons are lining the shores
to witness the attack.

	<text>Fort Sumpter surrendered yesterday,
Beauregard and three fire companies went
to it and extinguished the fire before it
reached the magazine. The Fort was
burned to a mere shell. The walls were
like honey comb. Anderson delivered up
his sword to Wiglall who returned it to him,

completely riddled. The floating battery

A Description of the Fortâ€”the Garri

The news of the contest at Charleston,

special interest to a description of that post.
The Herald of the 10th, has a lengthy arti
cle, from which we quote the following ex
tracts :
FORT SUMPTER.
Fort Sumpter is a modern truncated pen
tagonal fort, built upon an artificial island
at the mouth of Charleston harbor, three
and tbree-eigth miles from the city of
Charleston. The island has for its base a
sand and mud bank, with a superstructure,
if we may so term it, of the refuse chips
from several northern granite quarries.
These rocks are firmly imbedded in the sand,
and upon them the present fortification is
reared. The island itself cost half a mil
lion dollars, and was ten years in construc
tion- The fortification cost another half a
million dollars, and at the time of its occu
pancy by Major Anderson was so nearly
completed as to admit the introduction of
its armament...</text>

	<text>MANY CHERRY TREES
SHIPPED BY MIKADO
JAPAN SENDS U. S. OVER 2000
FINE SPECIMENS -
Many Saplings from Orient Will BÂ«
Planted Along Potomac and Riv
erside Driveways â€” Mrs.
Taft Recipient
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.â€”When tha
honorary commercial commissioners of
Japan arrives in Washington, Novem
ber 1, they will be taken on an auto
mobile ride which will include Poto
mac drive, along which 2000 cherry
trees to be presented to this country
by the emperor of Japan are to be
planted.
The shipment of the trees and the
planting thereof have been entrusted
to Toraklro Watase, proprietor of a
Tokio plant and seed company, who
is one of the commissioners.
Speaking of the gift of the emperor
to the city of Washington, Mr. Watase
said the trees would be sent to Mrs.
Taft, wife of the president, and by
her presented to the government for
transplanting- along- Potomac drive.
Former President Roosevelt and
President Taft are chiefly responsible
for the improvement of the Potomac
river front, and it was Mrs. Taft ivho
gave the name Potomac park to that
section of the city. She made popular
the afternoon promenades on the drive,
which were a feature last year of
summer life in the capital.
New York Remembered
The emperor of Japan Is sending to
New York also a large number of
cherry trees to be planted along River
side drive and Grant's tomb.
In Japan, the land of the cherry
blossom, there are many beautiful
legends about the trees and flower of
the cherry.
The blossom of the Japanese cherry
is of a peculiarly delicate beauty, and
there is a tradition in Japan that if
that same tone appears in the blos
soms of the Japanese cherry planted
in another country, that country can
he taken and subjugated by Japan.
Mr. Watase is authority for the
statement that while many Japanese
cherry trees have been brought to the
United States, the color of the bloa
eoms, although just as beautiful, is
unlike the blossom which appears in
Japan.</text>

â€” From the poems of Motoori.
AND the verses here printed, be
ing translated, tell:
"If one should in
quire of you concern
ing the spirit of a true Japanese,
point to the wild cherry blossom
shining in the sun."
Another Japanese proverb says:
"The cherry blossom is first among
flowers as the warrior is first
among men." The cherry blos
som is in Japan what the rose
is in England and the thistle in
Scotland. Practically it is worshipped
as the essential spirit of the goddess
of beauty and truth and loyalty to men
and country. </text>

rated officially. The blossoms will reach their
peak over the week-end. It is an

Washington has ever seen.
The blossoms were a gift to- this
country from Japan over a score
of years ago. Planted in a scenic
background which complements
their natural beauty, they have be

famous attractions. Railroads and

	<text>BOSTON'S SUBWAY OPENED.
Electrics Pus Through lor Public Traffic lor
First Time, Sept t.
Boston, Sept. 1.â€”Part of the subway,
the city's new underground thorough
fare for street cars, was formally
opened to public traffic at 6 oclock,
this morning. The sections which will
be operated for the present are those
under the common and the public gar
den, about three-quarters of a mile' in
length. The other sections are not
completed and will not probably be
opened until next spring.
The subway was begun in March,
1894. The total length of the line is one
and one-half miles and when com
pleted there will be about five miles of
track. The estimated cost of the un
dertaking is $5,500,000, although $7,000,
000 was appropriated by the city of
Boston, which has leased the subway
to the West End Street Railway for a
term of 20 years.
The construction of the subway is the
outcome of years of agitation to re
lieve the traffic on that part of Tre
mont street next the common and
other congested parts of the old section
of the city, where the narrow thor
oughfares become easily obstructed
and are practically impassable at
times.
The route opened, today. Is expected
to greatly relieve street traffic, n
nearly 2,000,000 passengers are carried
pearly on street cars on that part of
Tremont street.
The subway Is 14 feet high, 24 feet
wide where two tracks are laid and 48
feet w ide where there are four tracks.
There are five underground station* at
present and more wtjl be added a* the
work progresses *011 the incomplete sec
tions. The disastrous explosion of gaii
on March 4, last, occurred at the angle
of the sections opened today on the
corner of Tremont and Boylston streets.

	<text>THE BOSTON SUBWAY
To Be Open to Traffic on September 1.
Boston, Aug. 8. â€”The Boston subway
will be opened to public travel on Sep
tember 1; at least, that Is the present
intention of the West End Street Rail
way Company. It is not expected to
have all the details of construction com
pleted at that time, but they will be
sufficiently advanced to warrant the
dedication of the first three sections to
the uses of the electrical transit system.
All the ticket offices and turnstiles at
the foot of the station stairways are
practically completed, and are now be
ing painted to conform with the in
terior finish of the subway.</text>
